Conceptual Questions 


1. Linux is a free, open surce unix-like OS which uses the GNU General
 . Public Library (GPL) to remain open and free.It was created by Linus Toralds
   Linux was originally originally designed to handle the 386 processes by 
   Intel, but now it has been ported to nearly every computer architecture.
   Linux has been used in mobile phones, routers, televisions, consoles,
   toasters, desktop computers, most servers, and nearly every super computer
   in the world. 

2. A software that is "free" or open source means that its source code is 
   available to the general public for use and/or modifications from its 
   original design. This means anyone can edit and modify the code to add
   improvements for the community to use. A sftware that is open source uses
   the GNU GPL in order to implement a "copyleft" licenses that require it to 
   remain open, free, and accessible to anyone.

3. Since Linux is open source, it is free to everyone and anyone can edit and
   change it. However, anyone can make changes to the source code, for better
   or for worse. 


4. GNU GPL is an open source license

5. STDIN(0) - input
   STDOUT(1) - output
